# Sudoku
This is a Sudoku game made in C using the Windows API. It has a GUI, and you can play Sudoku or use it to solve puzzles. The Sudoku solver finds one solution. It runs in the Windows command prompt.

Compile by running the batch file, then run launcher.exe to play. Alternatively, compile sudoku.c and run it using the old Windows CMD, known as conhost.exe, located at C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe, not the newer terminal.
